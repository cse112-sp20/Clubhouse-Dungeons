## Summary

In early 2020, COVID-19 began making headlines, and by March companies around the globe were faced with a decision - to move entirely remote, if possible, or to shut down until it was deemed safe to reopen again. <br/><br/>
As developers, we were some of the lucky ones who were able to make the quick transition to remote work. However, the sudden and drastic change in our day to day lives was apparent in our motivation (or, in this case, the lack thereof). We were more isolated than we had ever been, and we realized we needed something FUN to keep us engaged with our work. <br/><br/>
So we created **Clubhouse Dungeons**, which is a gamified Burndown chart to keep our team on track for completing our sprints. This Google Chrome extension is accessible at any time while you are researching, looking through documentation, checking your email - as long as you’re in Chrome, you can see how well your team is doing. <br/><br/>
To use the app, you have to use your Clubhouse API token as your login. Then, you will be able to see a “Boss” with the same amount of health points as there are story points in your sprint! Any time you complete a task, you can check it off through Clubhouse Dungeons and watch as the Boss’ health goes down. You can also honor your teammates for doing a good job.  <br/><br/>
